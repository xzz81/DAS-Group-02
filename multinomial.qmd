## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
?glm
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv('dataset02.csv')
```

```{r}
head(data)
```

```{r}
library(nnet)



data$Type.of.Household <- factor(data$Type.of.Household,
                                 levels = c('Single Family' , 'Extended Famil' , 'multinom'))
  
data$Household.Head.Sex <- factor(data$Household.Head.Sex,
                                  levels = c('Male','Female'))

data$Electricity <- factor(data$Electricity,
                           levels = c('1','2'))


m1<-multinom(Total.Number.of.Family.members~Total.Household.Income+Total.Food.Expenditure+ Household.Head.Sex +Household.Head.Age+Type.of.Household +  House.Floor.Area +House.Age+ Number.of.bedrooms+Electricity,data=data)

summary(m1)
```

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

```{r}

m2<-glm(Total.Number.of.Family.members~Total.Household.Income+Total.Food.Expenditure+ Household.Head.Sex +Household.Head.Age+Type.of.Household +  House.Floor.Area +House.Age+ Number.of.bedrooms+Electricity,data=data , family = binomial)


```
