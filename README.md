Project overview:

This study focuses on the factors that influence household size in various regions of the Philippines by using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). We are trying to figure out how the variable:household income,food expenditure,household head age, bedroom numbers, house age, region, household head sex, type of household, electricity will effect the number of family members. Then using correlation analysis, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and cross-validation to filter the variables. Additionally, we evaluate our models using residual analysis to ensure their dependability.
